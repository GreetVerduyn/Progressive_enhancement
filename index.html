        <p>The story</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a <a href="https://jadepanugan.medium.com/the-story-of-the-chinese-farmer-by-alan-watts-b9ca01a16b47">Chinese farmer</a> whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said,<q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            The farmer said,<q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe</em></q>.”
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q>.
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            <a href="https://vtm.be/vtmgo/neighbours~p60dc504b-e702-49e0-b3a8-8ca6ae32db71?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">The neighbors</a> then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></q>, and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"<em>Maybe</em>.</q>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great! </q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
        </p>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> -</p>
        <br>
        <q> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</q>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
